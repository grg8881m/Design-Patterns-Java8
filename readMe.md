## What is a Design Pattern ? 

So getting started then, what exactly is a Design Pattern? Here are a couple of definitions for the term:

Extracted from Wikipedia:


> "A design pattern in architecture and computer science is a formal way of documenting a solution to a design problem in a particular
> field of expertise."


Extracted from Data & Object Factory:


> "Design patterns are recurring solutions to software design problems you find again and again in real-world application development.     
> Patterns are about design and interaction of objects, as well as providing a communication platform concerning elegant, reusable
> solutions to commonly encountered programming challenges. "


So a Design Pattern is a general purpose abstraction of a problem, which can be applied to a specific solution. As software developers tend to solve many similar types of problems, it makes sense that any software solution would incorporate similar elements from other solutions. 

In software engineering, a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. A design pattern is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

## Benefits of using Design Paterns

Design Patterns therefore provide the following benefits.

* They give the developer a selection of tried and tested solutions to work with
* They are language neutral and so can be applied to any language that supports object-orientation
* They aid communication by the very fact that they are well documented and can be researched if that is not the case.
* They have a proven track record as they are already widely used and thus reduce the technical risk to the project
* They are highly flexible and can be used in practically any type of application or domain
