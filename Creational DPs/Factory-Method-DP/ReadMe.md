# Factory Method Pattern

A Factory Pattern or Factory Method Pattern says that __just define an interface or abstract class for creating an object but let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate.__ In other words, subclasses are responsible to create the instance of the class.

The Factory Method Pattern is also known as Virtual Constructor.

With other words, Factory design pattern is used when we have a super class with multiple sub-classes and based on input, we need to return one of the sub-class. This pattern take out the responsibility of instantiation of a class from client program to the factory class.
